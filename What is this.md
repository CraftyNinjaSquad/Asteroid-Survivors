This is a passion project started by Noah Gardner while he was also working on Grim Gambit for Dirty Rat Games. He came up with the original idea during his soffmore year of high school in 2015. It was originaly just the main ship flyihg around in space shooting ships that spawned in and chased the player down. After the idea was shelved for years, Noah finally decided to remake that game with a twist: make it more like the classic arcade game Asteroids but in a 3D scene and add a rouge-like twist to it. Make something similar to Vampire Survivors or Megabonk. Noah proceded to make progress on the game as well as work on Grim Gambit at the same time in hopes that when it released, the rest of his team would help him finish what he started with his game.
